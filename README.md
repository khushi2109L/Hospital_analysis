# Hospital_analysis
📘 Overview

This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing key healthcare operational metrics such as waiting list distribution, case type trends, and specialty-wise performance.
The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor service demand, identify bottlenecks, and support data-driven decision-making for improving patient flow and resource allocation.

🎯 Objectives

1.Provide clear visibility into patient waiting lists and their distribution.
2.Compare average and median waiting times across various dimensions.
3.Analyze case types (e.g.Day Case , inpatient, outpatient) and their contribution to patient load.
4.Enable specialty-level filtering for deeper drill-down insights.

📈 Visuals Included
1.Bar charts for average/median wait times by Time Bands and Age Profile
2.Donut chart for waiting list by case type 
3.KPI cards for totals and performance snapshots
4.Drill down filter by Case Type and Speciality Name 

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

1.Power BI Desktop
2.DAX Measures for calculating averages, medians, and dynamic filters

🚀 Advancements & Enhancements
1.Cascading filters and interactive drill-through pages
2.Improved UI with consistent visuals and storytelling elements
3.Data quality checks and clean transformation pipeline
4.Performance tuning to reduce model size and load time
